1. Which, if any, of the following 3 code fragments are equivalent? Explain why they are different, if
they are. Explain why they can have different parameters and be equivalent, if they are equivalent.
		//code fragment 1
		$("li").each(function(idx, e) {
 			$(e).css(“color”, “yellow”); });
		//code fragment 2
		$("li").each(function() {
 			$(this).css(“color”, “yellow”); });
		//code fragment 3
		$("li").each(function(idx) {
 			$(this).css(“color”, “yellow”); });

ANSWER:  1. They are all equivalent

	The first code fragment uses the second argument which is the current element under consideration

	while the second and third code fragment uses the 'this' keyword which is also the current element under consdideration.

	Notice the idx variable(which is the current index) is being ignored in the third code fragment
